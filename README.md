Do It or Lose It - Mobile Gaming App (SNHU CS230 Project)

Project summary: "Draw It or Lose It" is a gaming app developed by The Gaming Room for Android devices. It involves teams guessing phrases using gradually revealed images. The company plans to expand by launching a web-based version with the help of Creative Technology Solutions.

I believe I effectively communicated the Domain Model portion of the documentation. By detailing the purpose of each class in the application and explaining their relationships, I could update the application to utilize a singleton design pattern.

My choice for revising a section of the documentation would be the Recommendations. I propose updating my suggestions to incorporate Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a cost-effective alternative.

A significant aspect of The Gaming Room's requirements and design constraints centered around ensuring that only one game instance was in memory and assigning unique IDs to each team and playerâ€”the singleton design pattern implemented the client requirements effectively.

My approach to software design emphasizes extensive note-taking and engaging with users directly. In the future, I aim to integrate a software design template to organize client requirements and streamline the design process systematically.
